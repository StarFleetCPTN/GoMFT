# Screenshots directory

This directory contains copies of the screenshots from the main repository root. These are used in the documentation site.

The contents of this directory are automatically updated by the `prepare-screenshots` script in the package.json file.

Do not manually add files to this directory as they will be overwritten by the scripts.
